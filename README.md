🚀 Machine Learning Repository  
Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository, where we explore key concepts and real-life applications of tensors and other foundational ML topics! This repository is designed to help learners grasp ML concepts with practical examples.  

📌 What's Inside?  
📖 **Basics of Tensors** – Understanding what tensors are and how they work.  
🌍 **Real-Life Applications** – Practical use cases of tensors in ML and AI.  
📝 **Well-Documented Code** – Clear explanations alongside code snippets.  

🔥 Why Tensors?  
Tensors are the fundamental data structures in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. They are used to represent multi-dimensional data, making them essential for:  
✅ **Computer Vision** – Image recognition, object detection, and segmentation.  
✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Text embeddings, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.  
✅ **Reinforcement Learning** – Training AI agents in simulated environments.  

🛠️ **Toy Project – Placement Prediction**  
A simple project that predicts whether placement will happen based on IQ and CGPA using **Logistic Regression**.  
📊 **Accuracy**: 80%  
🎯 **Goal**: Understand the end-to-end ML workflow.  
🖼️ **Visuals**: Good emoji usage and properly sized images for better clarity.
